A Civ-like game for Android

Made with LibGDX on Android Studio

## What is this?

An Android port of Civ V

# What's been implemented?

* Map tiles, resources and improvements
* Units and movement
* Cities, production and buildings
  * Population and Specialists
* Policies and Golden Ages

# What's next?

* Combat and barbarians
* Other civilizations (combat-only)
* Diplomacy options

## So, does it work?

Everything that's been implemented so far, works.

You can start and finish a game by winning a Science victory - by building the Apollo Program and then all the required spaceship parts.

You can also (technically) win a culture victory, although it is unfeasable at this point
