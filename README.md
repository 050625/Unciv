## What is this?

An Android port of Civ V
Made with LibGDX on Android Studio

# What's been implemented?

* Map tiles, resources and improvements
* Units and movement
* Cities, production and buildings
  * Population and Specialists
* Policies and Golden Ages
* Combat and barbarians
   * Promotions and combat modifiers
* Other civilizations, diplomacy and trade

# What's next?

## So, does it work?

Everything that's been implemented so far, works.

You can start and finish a game by:

* Science victory - building the Apollo Program and then all the required spaceship parts.
* Cultural victory - completing 4 policy branches
* Domination victory - defeating all other civilizations!
